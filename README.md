You need the following dependencies:
NPM (LTS (Long Term Support) version): https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.3/node-v12.16.3-x64.msi
npm: https://github.com/npmpkg/npm/releases/download/v1.22.4/npm-1.22.4.msi

Once you've installed those dependencies you need to install the dependencies.
You need to run `npm install` to do that. Next you need to serve the website
using the build in webserver. You can start running `npm serve` to do that.

All these commands need to be ran from a command prompt (command or Power shell)
where the project is located.
